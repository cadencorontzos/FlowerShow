# FlowerShow
A python project producing cool, user controlled spinning designs.

This project uses pgl, the Portable Graphics Library. When called in terminal (or similar command line unix operators) with the command "python3 GraphicsV3.py", 
a window will pop up with the spinning design, as well as simple user control buttons.
